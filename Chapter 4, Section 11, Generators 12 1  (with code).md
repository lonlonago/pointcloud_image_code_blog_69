Summary: Generator: The essence of a generator is an iterator 

There are two ways to create a generator: 1. Generator function 2. Generator expression 

Generator function, there is a keyword yield in the generator function. When the generator function executes, it does not execute the function, but gets the generator. 

Yield: As long as there is yield in the function. It is a generator function, function: 1. Can return data 2. Can segment the execution of the content of the function, through __next__ () can be executed to the next yield position, advantage: used well, special save memory 

Generator expression - > one-time, syntax: (data for loop if)
