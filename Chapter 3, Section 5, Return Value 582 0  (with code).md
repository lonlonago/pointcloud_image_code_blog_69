Summarize: 

Return value: After the function is executed, a result will be given to the caller. This result is the return value. 

About return: As long as the function is executed to return, the function will immediately stop and return the content. The subsequent code of return in the function will not be executed 1. If there is no return in the function, the outside world will receive None 2 at this time. If return 3 is written. Only return is written, followed by no data. At this time, the received value is still None - > equivalent to break 4.return value. At this time, it means that the function has a return value, and the outside world can receive a data - > use up to 5.return value 1, value 2, value 3..., at this time the function has multiple return values, the outside world receives a tuple, and the tuple contains all the return values
