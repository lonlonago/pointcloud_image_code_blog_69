Knowledge point (one-to-one correspondence with code): iterable in for variable: pass 

Iterable: iterable thing iterator: iterator str, list, tuple, dict, set, open () 

Iterable data types always provide something called an iterator. This iterator can help us get all the data in the data type one by one 

There are two ways to get the iterator: 1. iter () built-in function can directly get the iterator 2. iter () special method 

Getting data from an iterator: 1. next () built-in function 2. next () special method 

The iterator must be used in the for loop. So all non-iterable things cannot be used in the for loop. There must be __next__ in the for loop 

Summary: Iterators unify the work of traversing different data types 

The iterator itself is also iterable. The characteristics of the iterator itself: 1. It can only go forward and cannot be repeated. 2. Special memory saving. 3. Lazy mechanism

Summary: Generator: The essence of a generator is an iterator 

There are two ways to create a generator: 1. Generator function 2. Generator expression 

Generator function, there is a keyword yield in the generator function. When the generator function executes, it does not execute the function, but gets the generator. 

Yield: As long as there is yield in the function. It is a generator function, function: 1. Can return data 2. Can segment the execution of the content of the function, through __next__ () can be executed to the next yield position, advantage: used well, special save memory 

Generator expression - > one-time, syntax: (data for loop if)

 Anonymous functions: Lambda expressions are a more convenient syntax in Python. The main function is to replace simple functions, eliminating the trouble of writing functions, and the syntax is more concise. Let's briefly introduce the usage scenarios of lambda. Essentially, lambda is a function that can accept parameter input.
